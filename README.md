"# qb-clothing-esx" 
#What differents?
- My resource work stable with ESX Plume, idk with ESX
- It doesn't need to create new table for save data, I was converted from QB Data to ESX and use default ESX save skins by function Config.ConvertFromQbusToESX and Config.ConvertFromESXToQbus
- You can parallel use esx_clothes with this version, it's work very nice
#Require:
-esx_datastore -> save outfits
-esx_skin -> save skins
